## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Learned how to structure HTML based off of a given design. Learned a little more about CSS flexbox -> still feels foreign to an extent.

### Continued development

I definitely want to get better at CSS in general. I feel like a lot of the concepts are still mending and connecting. I have a tendency of being unsure why something works the way it does - and I want to get better at going deeper in understanding why something works ie sizing and formatting in CSS.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own plans for continued development.**

### Useful resources
