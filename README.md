## My process

- Structure the HTML based off of the Figma Design
- Add styling based off of the design

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Learned how to structure HTML based off of a given design. Learned a little more about CSS flexbox -> still feels foreign to an extent.

### Continued development

I definitely want to get better at CSS in general. I feel like a lot of the concepts are still mending and connecting. I have a tendency of being unsure why something works the way it does - and I want to get better at going deeper in understanding why something works ie sizing and formatting in CSS.
